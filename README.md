# Olfactory

This repo explores the analysis from:

McDermott, R., Tingley, D., & Hatemi, P. (2014). Assortative Mating Could Operate Through Olfactory Cues. American Journal of Political Science , 58 (4), 997-1005. [link](https://scholar.harvard.edu/dtingley/publications/assortative-mating-could-operate-through-olfactory-cues)

The [code/data](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/24789) is available from the Harvard Dataverse, but I have included copies here for pedagogical purposes.
